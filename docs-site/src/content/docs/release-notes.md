Scion release notes are published weekly.

## Latest: Week of September 21 -- 27, 2026

The grove→project rename reached its breaking phase: legacy grove routes, CLI flags, API keys, event topics, container labels, environment variables and hub↔broker wire fields were removed, on-disk state now migrates automatically, and hub and broker must be upgraded together. Alongside it, a broad authorization sweep closed cross-member and cross-project exposure paths, single-node VM deployment became headless, self-updating and Vertex-ready out of the box, and the persistent terminal workspace gained shareable layouts and auto-reconnect.

## Timezone handling changes

After the week of September 21, timezone handling changed: the Hub sends every timestamp in UTC with `Z`, the web dashboard has a per-user display timezone and a 24-hour clock, and cron schedules are UTC only. The runtime-profile `timezone` setting introduced that week ([release notes](/scion/release-notes/2026-09-21/)) has been removed: an agent's `TZ` now comes from its pin, `TZ` environment variables on the Hub, or the Hub default timezone. See [Times and Timezones](/scion/reference/times-and-timezones/) for the full behaviour and the operator steps after upgrading.

## Migration guides

- [Migrating from raw message delivery](/scion/reference/raw-message-removal/): raw keystroke delivery through messages is removed. `scion message --raw` fails before sending anything, and any message request that still carries `raw` is refused with `422 raw_input_removed`. Use `scion keys` or `POST .../keys` instead.
