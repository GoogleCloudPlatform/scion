# Render-time guard assertions for deploy/helm/scion-hub, other than the
# reserved-flag list (tests/reserved-flags.sh) and the updateStrategy
# derivation (tests/update-strategy.sh). Those two are separate because they
# were separately verified; between the three, every render-time refusal in
# _helpers.tpl has at least one case.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, same contract as its two siblings: it asserts the number of
# assertions EXECUTED against a committed total and exits 2 on a short run,
# distinct from 1 for a real failure. "The harness did not run" and "the chart
# is broken" need different reactions from whoever sees red. Absence of a
# failure is not evidence of a check.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately. Phase 6 owns that and may relocate this file.
#
# WHY SO MANY CASES ASSERT THE MESSAGE AND NOT JUST THE EXIT CODE: several of
# these guards are layered, and a layered guard silently becomes a single point
# of failure the moment you assert only the outcome. Where two independent
# layers refuse the same value, there is one case per layer, and the lower layer
# is reached with --skip-schema-validation - which is how an operator reaches it
# too.
